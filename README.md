# ☕ Coffee Quality Analysis

## 📌 Introduction

Coffee is one of the most traded commodities globally, with its quality playing a crucial role in consumer satisfaction and market value. As demand for premium coffee rises, understanding the factors that contribute to its quality becomes essential. This project presents an in-depth visual and statistical analysis of coffee quality attributes, aiming to uncover key patterns, trends, and insights that can guide producers, exporters, and buyers in making informed decisions.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As the specialty coffee industry continues to grow, pinpointing the characteristics that drive coffee quality is vital for stakeholders across the supply chain. Without clear insights, opportunities to enhance product standards and profitability may be missed.

**Goal**:  

1. To analyze coffee data across multiple dimensions and answer key questions such as:

2. Which sensory attributes most strongly influence overall quality scores?

3. How do quality scores vary by country and processing method?

4. What is the typical profile of high-scoring coffees?

5. How are attributes like aroma, acidity, and body distributed across samples?

6. This analysis helps in identifying quality drivers, supporting better cultivation practices, pricing strategies, and consumer education.

## 🔍 Key Insights

Arabica coffees make up most of the dataset and typically achieve higher quality scores than Robusta.

Attributes like aroma, acidity, and body show strong positive correlations with overall quality.

Certain countries and regions consistently produce coffees with superior flavor profiles.

Natural and washed processing methods both yield high-quality coffees but exhibit different attribute distributions.

A few outliers with exceptionally high balance and sweetness significantly elevate overall scores.
